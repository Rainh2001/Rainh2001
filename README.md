- I'm primarily interested in web application development (mainly front-end) and computer science oriented interactive applications.
- I'm currently studying the Bachelor of Computing Science (Honours) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS).
- I'm looking to collaborate on interactive web applications that focus on developing a deeper understanding of computer science fields.
